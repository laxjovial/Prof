**How to Use This Tool:**

1.  **Text to Process:** Enter the main content you want the AI to analyze, summarize, translate, etc.
2.  **AI Instruction (User Prompt):** Tell the AI precisely what task to perform on the text. Be clear and specific!
3.  **AI Persona (System Prompt):** Define the role or characteristics you want the AI to adopt (e.g., 'You are a financial analyst', 'You are a poet'). This influences its tone and style.
4.  **Output Format:** Choose how you want the AI's final response to be structured (paragraph, table, list, or JSON).
5.  **Generate AI Response:** Click the button to get your AI-powered output!

**Note:** Ensure your `Together AI API Key` is set in a `.env` file (e.g., `api_key="your_key_here"`) or entered directly into the input field at the top.
