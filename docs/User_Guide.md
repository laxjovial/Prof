# User Guide: Welcome to the Educational AI Platform!

This guide will walk you through all the features of the Educational AI Platform and how to use them to enhance your learning and teaching experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Logging In

To begin, simply enter a unique username in the sidebar on the left and click "Login". This will create a new session for you or resume your previous one, loading your past conversation history.

### 2. The Interface

The application is divided into two main areas:
-   **The Sidebar (Left)**: This is your control panel. Here you can log in, configure the AI, and upload documents.
-   **The Main Chat Window (Center)**: This is where you will interact with the AI.

## Configuring Your AI Assistant

You have two powerful ways to control the AI's behavior, both located in the sidebar.

### AI Persona

This text box allows you to define the role you want the AI to play. Be specific!

-   *Example 1*: `You are a patient and encouraging math tutor who specializes in algebra.`
-   *Example 2*: `You are a world-renowned historian with a focus on the Roman Empire.`
-   *Example 3*: `You are a professional translator fluent in English and Japanese.`

### Educational Level

This optional field lets you set the complexity of the AI's language and concepts. This is perfect for tailoring the content to a specific audience.

-   *Examples*: `Primary School`, `High School (Grade 10)`, `University (Undergraduate)`, `Expert`, `Novice`.

## Interacting with the AI

### Standard Chat

Simply type your question or prompt into the chat box at the bottom of the screen and press Enter. The AI's response will appear, and the conversation will be saved automatically.

### Generating Content

You can ask the AI to generate structured educational content at any time using the buttons in the sidebar. The AI will use your current conversation as context.

-   **Generate Curriculum**: Creates a high-level plan of study for a subject.
-   **Generate Syllabus**: Creates a more detailed syllabus for a specific course or topic.
-   **Generate Test**: Creates a test with relevant questions.

## Using Your Own Documents (RAG)

The most powerful feature of this platform is its ability to use your own documents as a knowledge source.

### 1. Upload and Process

-   In the sidebar, find the "Upload & Process Document" section.
-   Click "Browse files" to upload a `.pdf` or `.txt` file.
-   Click the **"Process Document"** button. The AI will read and memorize your document.

### 2. Context-Aware Chat

Once a document is processed, the AI will automatically use it as the primary source for its answers. You can ask specific questions about the content of your document.

### 3. Toggling Document Context

If you want to ask the AI a general question without using the document, simply uncheck the **"Use Document Context"** box in the sidebar. You can check it again at any time to re-enable the RAG feature.

### 4. Generating Questions from Your Document

After processing a document, a new button, **"Generate Questions from Document"**, will appear. Click this to have the AI create a test based specifically on the material in your uploaded file.
