## 5. AI Tutor Chat

This is your own personal chat interface with the AI. It's a powerful tool for preparing lessons, generating ideas, and exploring topics.

### How to Prepare a Lesson on Any Topic
You can use the same two-step conversational method that students use for learning to prepare your own teaching materials.

**Step 1: Generate a Lesson Plan**
Ask the AI to create a roadmap for a lesson.
- *Example Prompt*: `"Generate a 4-part lesson plan for teaching the water cycle to 5th graders."`
The AI will give you a structured plan, which is now saved in your chat history.

**Step 2: Flesh Out the Plan Conversationally**
Walk through the plan to generate the actual content for your lesson.
- *Example Prompt*: `"This looks good. For part 1, 'Evaporation', write a simple explanation and a fun classroom activity."`
You can continue this process for each part of the lesson plan, building a complete set of teaching notes right in your chat history.

### Other Chat Features
- **Configure the AI**: Use the sidebar to set the AI's persona and educational level.
- **Use Documents (RAG)**: Upload your own materials via the "Knowledge Base" to have the AI use them as context for lesson planning.
