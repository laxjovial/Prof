### How to Learn Any Topic
The platform uses a powerful two-step conversational method for teaching:

Ask the AI to create a roadmap for any topic you want to learn.

The AI will give you a structured plan, which is now saved in your chat.

Walk through the plan at your own pace by talking to the AI.
