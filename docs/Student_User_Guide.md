### How to Learn Any Topic
The platform uses a powerful two-step conversational method for teaching:

**Step 1: Generate a Learning Plan**
Ask the AI to create a roadmap for any topic you want to learn.

The AI will give you a structured plan, which is now saved in your chat.

Walk through the plan at your own pace by talking to the AI.

When you're ready, just tell the AI to proceed:
